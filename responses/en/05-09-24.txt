Plan
Create a PackagingLine instance with the necessary number of sub-machines.
Attach funnels to the sub-machines to handle the 400 cookies (each funnel handles 100 cookies).
Add conveyer belts to connect the sub-machines.
Add packaging robots to the sub-machines to handle the cookies.
Ensure the conveyer belt is scanned before the picker can pick up the cookies.

Python Script
This script sets up a packaging line with 4 sub-machines, each equipped with a funnel, a scanner, and a picker. The conveyer belt connects all sub-machines, ensuring that the cookies can be processed efficiently.
