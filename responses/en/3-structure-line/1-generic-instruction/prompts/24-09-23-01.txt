and the facts:
- The goal of the packaging line is to place items on trays.
- A tray has a maximum capacity of 40 items.
- A packaging line consists of submachines.
- A submachine can contain different types of robots.
- A submachine can contain at most 4 robots.
- A submachine can contain conveyor belts.
- A submachine can contain at most 3 conveyor belts.
- Items are input into the packaging line using a funnel.
- Only one funnel can be attached to a submachine.
- A funnel supplies 100 items per unit of time.
- Items and trays are moved by conveyor belts.
- A conveyor belt can carry either items or trays.
- A conveyor belt for trays carrys 4 trays.
- Items are placed on trays by a robotic arm called the "picker".
- The picker can pick up at most 30 items at a time.
- The picker counts towards the robot limit in a submachine.
- For a picker to pick up an item, the items position must be known.
- To know the position of an item, the item must be scanned.
- The machine that can scan items is called the "scanner".
- The scanner can scan an arbitrary amount of items.
- The scanner can only scan items that arriving on a conveyor belt.
- The scanner can not scan items that are input in the same submachine as the scanner.
- Once an item has been scanned, it does not have to be scanned ever again.
- The scanner can scan all belts in a submachine.
- The scanner counts towards the robot limit in a submachine.
- All components of a packaging line have a cost.
- The base cost of a packaging line is 1000.
- The cost of a submachine is 500.
- The base cost of a conveyor belt is 50.
- For every submachine the conveyor belt is spanning, the cost is increased by 5.
- The cost of a picker is 100.
- The cost of a scanner is 3000.
- The cost of a funnel is 25.

Write a python function that only uses the given API to return a packaging line with enough capacity to package 100 items in one unit of time. The packaging line should have the lowest possible cost.
Make sure to not implement any functions. Only use the given functions.

Think step by step. Create a detailed plan before actually implementing the function. Your plan has to include each necessary inference step to correctly construct the packaging line. Solve each problem explicitly, i.e. computation of values depending on the requirements or limits imposed by the provided facts. When it comes to the structure of the packaging, explicitly describe the relative dependencies of all components used in the packaging line and why it is correct to structure the packaging line this way. Find a way to efficiently describe the packaging line after each step of the plan.
Only after you have performed all the inference steps needed to create a correct packaging line should you write the function. When writing the function indicate which step of the plan you are implementing by using a comment.
