Given the functions:
[functions]

and the types:
[types]

and the constants:
PICKER_CAPACITY = 25
ITEMS_PER_TRAY = 50
TRAYS_PER_BELT = 20
ITEMS_PER_FUNNEL = 100
ROBOT_PER_SUBMACHINE = 4
BELTS_PER_SUBMACHINE = 3

Compute how many pickers, scanners and funnel are necessary to process 100 items. Then compute how many submachines are needed to fit all the robots requierd.
