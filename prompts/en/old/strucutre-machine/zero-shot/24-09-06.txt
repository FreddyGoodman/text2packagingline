Given the functions:
[functions]

and the types:
[types]

and the constants:
PICKER_CAPACITY = 25
ITEMS_PER_TRAY = 50
TRAYS_PER_BELT = 20
ITEMS_PER_FUNNEL = 100
ROBOT_PER_SUBMACHINE = 4
BELTS_PER_SUBMACHINE = 3

Write a python script that uses the given function and types to instanciates a PackagingLine with enough capacity to package all cookies. The machine needs enough capacity to packages 400 items. The items can be picked up by a "picker" but only if the converyer belt was previously scanned by a "scanner". The PackagingLine needs to place the item in trays, which need to move through the machine too. Use the minimal amount of machines necessary.
