Write a python function that only uses the given API to return a packaging line with enough capacity to package 100 items. The packaging line should have the lowest possible cost.
Make sure to not implement any functions. Only use the given functions.

First we want to compute how many submachines the are needed to store all robots and belts required to meet the capacity requirement. 
Start by computing how many funnels are necessary to input all items into the machine. Do that by dividing the total amount of items by the a single funnels capacity and rounding up the result.
Next we compute how many scanners are needed. Do that by identifiying the capacity of a single scanner and then infere how many are need at least. Use the smallest amount of scanners.
Compute how many pickers are necessary to place all items in trays. Do that by dividing the total amount of items by the a single pickers capacity and rounding up the result. 
Add the two types of robots together and compute how many submachines are needed to house all robots.
Now we have to plan the structure of the packaging line. To do this correctly, we have to follow the constraints of the given API. Decide where we should place the funnels and robots in the packaging line so the items can be processed correctly. Determine if it is useful to have funnels and robots in the same submachine. Use these considerations to calculate the amount of submachines needed.
Create a packaging line object with the calculated amount of submachines. 
Then attach the required amount of funnels to the submachines where you previously planned them to go. And lastly add the required robots to the submachines again using the structure you previously planned.
The final step is to compute how many tray belts are necessary to have enough space available for all items. First, multiply the amount a single tray can hold with the amount of trays that one belt can carry and divide the result by the amount of items the machine should use. Round up the result and distribute the tray belts so that all items can be processed and as much picker capacity as possible is used.
The last step is to attach an item belt that connects all submachines, that require items to be transported through them.
